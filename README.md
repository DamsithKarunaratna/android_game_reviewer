# CTSE Project - *Game Reviewer*

## Objective

As a Game Reviewer app user I need to be able to add a Game that I played and add a review comment. If the Game is already available in the list I should be able to add more review comments.

## Specification
There are two main components to this Assignment.
### 1. Source Code
The Android app has to include particular features as follows:


- [ ] The app should get data through a web service or a server
- [ ] Web service to call up brands
- [ ] It must contain an “input” screen where the user has to enter data
- [ ] Must include a list (with an underlying SELECT)
- [ ] Must do INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, DELETE on the database
- [ ] Must have at least 1 list screen, 1 input screen, 1 extra screen (e.g. splash, or help).
- [ ] Use at least two Android features not covered in class. 

The purpose of this is to demonstrate your proficiency at using the API to discover new features, which you can then implement because you should have built up enough general familiarity with Android to be able to do this. Examples of features might be using menus on your screen, tabs, multi-row lists, linking to camera, linking to network, animated images, location services, preferences, dialogs, etc. Your choice.

### 2. Detailed report
You should write a complete report describes your app with following Criteria.
- **Screen shots** of all UI’s
- **Xml and java code** (not screen shots). Copy and paste your codes.
- All the **references**

## What do you have to hand in?
Project Code AND a screen print: Provide a single zipped file containing all directories/files
in your Android project and a detailed report. Therefore, all classes, source code,
resources, manifest file etc will be included. You should also include a screen print of the
main opening menu/screen of your app. Include IT number in the zipped file name e.g.
IT15895623.zip

>  Note: Code that does not include the following will not be marked  
>  
> comment header block on each .java file;   
> Inline comments at the beginning of each method;   
> Appropriately indented tidy java code.
How will your app code be marked?

## Marks for the source code for the app will be as follows.
- **Accuracy/ Completeness** (50%) – for supplying the deliverables listed (code), and
for handing in an app that meets the various points in the specification. Your app
should work without runtime errors so test it.
- **Quality of the user interface** (20%) –Are the screens easy to use? Are they laid out
neatly? Do they look viable?
- **Overall quality and complexity of the app** (30%) –Does your app function well and
robustly? What extra features beyond the standard functionality requested are
included? How viable and complex is it?




#### Important

***Any code snippets that are not directly written by you (e.g. used from a tutorial)
must be referenced as such within your code. You must directly comment the code
to explain its source. Failure to reference code that is not yours will be treated as
plagiarism. See next regulation.
The app must be your own work. Assignments that are copied or written by
someone else will receive zero marks, and the plagiarism escalated as per DIT
assessment regulations.***
